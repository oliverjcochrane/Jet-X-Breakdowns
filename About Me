# Jet-X-Breakdowns

I am a writer and contributor for www.jetsxfactor.com where you can find the best New York Jets content on the whole internet.

As an aspiring Data Scientist, I will make breakdowns of players, position groups, or games for your reading pleasure using R-based statistics.

All the code behind my project will be posted here for you to observe and learn from, so feel free to take a look "behind-the-scenes" of how I make
my calculations, where the data comes from, and how I present the data in various forms!
